After leaving Sophie’s hometown of Kirchen Bell, the pair discovers a huge tree identical to one that Plachta had seen in a dream, and as they get closer, a mysterious vortex pulls them inside. Sophie awakens alone in a curious new world called Erde Wiege, and it’s not long before she hears about an alchemist named Plachta that lives on the outskirts of town. Shockingly, when Sophie arrives at the atelier, she meets a young alchemy enthusiast named Plachta, and even though the alchemist shares the same name as her friend, she doesn’t recognize Sophie. What other surprises await Sophie on this journey? As the adventure continues, Sophie meets aspiring alchemist, Ramizel Erlenmeyer, who willingly agrees to help her in her time of need. The narrative elegantly unfolds with a charming new visual style that combines the art of the Mysterious sub-series with the high-quality graphics and animations featured in 2021’s Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends and the Secret Fairy.\n\nOn her journey to find her missing friend, Sophie will have to fight the many monsters that inhabit the lands of Erde Wiege. As soon as players encounter an enemy in the field, the battle begins instantly without any load times or separate screens – a series first – allowing battles to flow seamlessly. In addition, battle parties now consist of six members, with three in the front and three in the back, to form two teams that co-operate in multi-linked turn-based battles. This new battle system opens up a wide range of exciting combat strategies that players can utilize to take out their foes."

      "synopsis": "The town of Moonbury has always been wary of the advances of the outside world, preferring to rely on their traditional methods of healing. Until one day, when the mayor's daughter falls ill, and the local witch doctor can do nothing to help her, they are forced to look outside their small community for help.\nThe Medical Association decides to send their most accomplished chemist - you - to help cure the mayor's daughter and convince the residents of Moonbury of the wonders of modern alchemy. Gain their trust and tend to each person when they fall ill in this open-ended sim RPG.\n\nFeatures\n• Take care of residents. Moonbury has around 30 unique inhabitants who will occasionally fall ill and call for your aid. Sick residents will have their schedules interrupted while they recuperate in bed.\n• Diagnose symptoms and find a cure! Hmm... a low heart rate and a bloated liver. Shoulder cramps, perhaps? No, these are sure signs of burning lungs. This patient has been consuming too much gelatin! Easily remedied; you'll just need to craft some Minty Goblet.\n• Gather ingredients out in the world. Once you've decided on a potion, ointment, or salve, gather ingredients from the surrounding environment using your tools. Upgrade your hammer, axe, and sickle for new swings and attacks to help with your day-to-day tasks. Watch out for changing weather conditions! You may find yourself caught out in the rain, a freezing blizzard, or even the baking heat of a desert.\n• Confront nasty monsters for their materials. Sometimes you won't be able to gather the materials you need as easily as harvesting a berry bush, and you'll need to turn your trusty tools into weapons to collect materials from the monsters prowling the nearby wilderness. Combat is in real-time and, since you're a chemist, you'll be able to brew various concoctions to buff yourself or inflict status ailments on your adversaries, as well as various tools to aid you.\n• Brew remedies in your cauldron. The ingredients you gather can be mixed in your cauldron to brew medicine, vitamins, and more. As you become more experienced, higher-level recipes will become available, requiring more ingredients but bestowing stronger effects. Enhance your cauldron to concoct more ingredients into your recipes for these more advanced remedies.\n• Build relationships with the townsfolk. It'll take a little while, but your patients' health will be much better thanks to your efforts. Your reputation with them will increase, and they'll open up to you a little more. You may even find yourself growing particularly close to certain bachelors or bachelorettes.\n• Upgrade the town and surrounding areas. Building relationships with townsfolk increases your approval rating allowing you to improve the area by improving public buildings and expanding the explorable areas around the town. You can also craft and buy new furniture to give your home a personal touch!\n• Enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside. In the downtime between treating the community's ailments, you'll be able to freely explore in and around Moonbury. Get to know the inhabitants a little better, take a rest in the tavern, or go fishing to catch something for dinner. Moonbury is a delightfully charming location where time seems a little slower and life is just a little more relaxed than in the big city. While the lighting will change throughout the day, with the bright sun streaking across the meadows in the morning and street lamps illuminating the town in the early evening, there are no time limits for game objectives. You are free to go at your own pace and take it easy.\n• Spend time with a faithful companion. You didn't relocate to Moonbury alone! With you every step of the way is your loyal dog companion. Your pet can help you locate hidden items and point you in the direction of residents as they go about their day."

The completely revamped AI enables enemies to adapt their tactics to the situation, providing a battle system that always keeps you thinking and never grows old.\n\n-The class-wide level management system used in Tactics Ogre (2010) has changed to a unit-by-unit level system.

If you wonder what a different choice would have led to, now you can find out!\n\n-Traveling back isn't limited to the story; the Chariot Tarot lets you rewind up to a certain number of moves during battle. In a game of tactical battles where a single mistake can mean the difference between victory and defeat, you can play without worrying that you'll back yourself into a corner.\n\n-Enjoy a wealth of endgame content such as the 100-level Palace of the Dead.

These classic games popularized the first-person shooter and allow players to wield an arsenal of powerful weapons as you battle demon hordes on Mars, on Earth, and across Hell. DOOM: You’re one of Earth’s toughest marines stationed on mars when a military experiment opens the gates to hell. It’s up to you to beat back the demon hordes with an arsenal of brutal weapons in DOOM, the game that pioneered the first-person shooter genre and changed video games forever. DOOM II: The beloved sequel to the groundbreaking DOOM (1993), DOOM II sends you to Earth, gives players the brutal Super Shotgun to bear against deadlier demons, and makes you face an iconic boss, the Icon of Sin. DOOM 3: In this critically acclaimed action-horror re-telling of the original DOOM, players battle their way through a dimly-lit and terrifying, demon-infested UAC facility on Mars before entering the abyss to battle Hell's mightiest warrior."

So a group of scientists use the Gaia Supercomputer to create an &quot;Earth Simulator&quot; to prevent it from happening but fail because the human birth potential has dropped dramatically.\n\nThe scientists then introduce the &quot;Arecibo Message&quot; formula to the Earth Simulator, successfully bringing mankind into another world. They are excited at first until they realize that human beings in the Earth Simulator themselves created another Earth Simulator. The scientists begin to suspect that they are actually only the product of an Earth Simulator from creatures whose position is above them.\n\nThe story centers around Takaoka Pollon, a hacker who has the ability to &quot;Save and Load&quot; like in a video game. Using his Hacking Trigger System, he can intervene with the world line around him."

Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.\n\nEmbark on an epic voyage\nAt the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit.\n\nFind your own destiny\nYour voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry.\n\nOr a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards.\n\nOr perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover places and things that no one has ever seen before. Upgrade your engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in toxic environments that would kill the unwary.\n\nShare your journey\nThe galaxy is a living, breathing place. Trade convoys travel between stars, factions vie for territory, pirates hunt the unwary, and the police are ever watching. Every other player lives in the same galaxy, and you can choose to share your discoveries with them on a map that spans known space. Perhaps you will see the results of their actions as well as your own.."

The personal lives of these young celebrities are a part of your business, and the life of a pop star isn't always a happy one. Their crowning personal achievements can be your greatest commercial successes, but their emotional meltdowns and PR nightmares can spell financial disaster for your company.\n\nIt's not just the idols you have to worry about. The world is full of gossip magazines, super fans, and rival groups, all thirsty for a scoop on the latest scandal. There are a lot of people who want to tear you down and are willing to play dirty, but try not to let it get to you. It's not personal, it's business."

The school that had employed her is located in the 48th prefecture of Japan known as the Aima Prefecture and is a training school designed to educate inexperienced UMA so that they can become fully-fledged UMA.\n\nIn fact, Koyomi had accidentally undertaken the &quot;animal trainer&quot; employment exam instead of the &quot;teacher&quot; exam!\n\n&quot;This is impossible for me,&quot; said Koyomi, as she was about to decline her offer of employment. In response to this, the school's principal promised, &quot;if you can work admirably for us for one year, I'll put in a good word for you to other high schools.&quot;\n\nHaving no experience whatsoever in the art of training, will Koyomi be able to train a UMA?\n\nAlso, will she be able to assist in the growth of an inexperienced UMA into an excellent one?\n\nFor the sake of being able to transfer to a different high school- though filled with her doubts- Koyomi's year-long life as a homeroom teacher-cum-&quot;animal trainer&quot; will begin!"

For nearly a decade, Draknek &amp; Friends have been crafting bespoke, lovingly designed puzzle experiences that take a theme, mechanic, or ludicrous idea and push it to its natural conclusion. This collection features four of these award-winning experiences, packaged together on a single Nintendo Switch cartridge for over 100 hours of head-scratching goodness. \n\nThe crown jewel of this collection is A Monster’s Expedition, an open-world puzzle adventure that casts players as a monster exploring an archipelago museum of human culture. The game’s central log-rolling mechanic unfolds &amp; unfurls into escalating complexities that have you constantly reconsidering the space around you both laterally and logically. That space, too, is presented in such a fun and welcoming aesthetic that frustration is consistently held at bay — learning becomes a genuine pleasure, as it should be. \n\nAnd that’s just ONE of the FOUR brilliant puzzle games you get here! We could go on and on about the charm of A Good Snowman is Hard to Build, the sublime pleasures of spending hours in Sokobond, or the seemingly endless satisfaction that comes from planning routes in Cosmic Express, but we’ll let you discover the magic on your own."

A port was later made in Japan for more advanced hardware under the name of &quot;Akai Katana Shin&quot;, and thanks to the 16:9 screen ratio, the game became even more intuitive. Finally, a third opus was made later under the name of &quot;ZetsuAkai Katana&quot;, in which the quality of life and the balance of the game have been revised. Each game will ask you to use different tactics, so prepare yourself.\n\nStory\n\nThis is a story about reviving hopes, set in the high-growth period of a fictive country that looks just like Japan. This period is called &quot;Taisho&quot;.Thanks to high growth, technology developed itself rapidly and resources like coal or electricity have been replaced by a new resource called &quot;Guiding ore&quot;. This Guidance stone can supply anything. Likewise, it can be used to create a &quot;Guiding katana&quot;, a special type of blade that can be held by anybody in possession of a special seal.\n\nWhen a Guiding katana takes the life of somebody, it transforms into a red sword, a &quot;Blood Katana&quot;, and thus doesn't need flesh to accumulate Guidance. As a small country, to surpass foreign countries and to protect itself, a war broke out. Basho, the leader of the empire, formed an army of elites to fight neighboring countries. They are called &quot;The Celestial Stems&quot; and are praised by everybody. &quot;This is a privilege to serve and protect one's country and one should sacrifice their life if it helps make the country great and powerful&quot;; such are the words of the Emperor…"

The reign of the Tokugawa was passed down to the fourth Shogun, Ietsuna. The number of people living in Edo increased day by day, and the city seemed to be enjoying its prosperity. However, due to a succession of dissolutions and revocations by the feudal lords, the streets were filled with ronin, and the peaceful days of Edo seemed to be fading.\n\nIn Asakusa, a town in Edo, there was a young man named Miyamoto Iori. He was the adopted son and apprentice of the great swordsman Miyamoto Musashi. Iori chose not to serve under a lord, but rather spent his days training his swordsmanship. One day, he noticed an unfamiliar bruise on the back of his hand. Iori would soon find himself trapped in the midst of a horrific conflict, a battle of blood and trickery.\n\nThe battle over the &quot;Waxing Moon&quot; which could grant any and all wishes - the &quot;Waxing Moon Ritual&quot;. The seven individuals seeking their wish, or Masters, are the bearers of the Ritual. The seven Heroic Spirits, or Servants, are summoned to this world by their Masters. The curtain rises on the battle between the seven Masters with their seven Servants.\n\n“I suppose...you're the one who summoned me?"

New locations with multiple routes and secret areas!\nPlay solo or team up with a friend, locally or online\nNew hired henchmen aid players in battle! Hold two recruits at once!\nLoads of NPCs to meet, interact with, and punch in the face – including surprise cameos!\nRiver City Girls\nKick butt, take names, and pound punks in this all-new installment of the classic co-op beat-’em-up series!\n\nRiver City Girls stars Kyoko and Misako, two street-tough high-schoolers who must fight their way through the six regions of River City to rescue their kidnapped boyfriends, series mainstays Kunio and Riki. Along the way, they’ll utilize an arsenal of combos, counters, throws, and special attacks; battle an assortment of enemies; accept numerous side quests; level up with experience points; interact with NPCs (including guest stars from past River City games); and shop for a variety of items, food, and gear to boost stats and unlock new abilities. The girls can even wield weapons and recruit defeated foes to join them in combat!\n\nThe one- or local two-player bare-knuckle brawling is complemented by spectacular 16-bit-style graphics and an epic synth-pop soundtrack (featuring NateWantsToBattle, Chipzel, Christina Vee, and Megan McDuffee!), while the story roars to life via glorious anime cutscenes and manga-style intermissions.\n\nRiver City Girls 2\nPicking up where the first RCG left off, River City Girls 2 throws hot-blooded high-schoolers Misako, Kyoko, Kunio, and Riki — along with newcomers Marian and Provie — into the fight of their lives when an old foe returns to wreak havoc. But the girls (and guys) aren’t just giving up; they’re fighting back with new stat-altering accessories, new items, new weapons, and additional moves (such as Kyoko’s Cartwheel Kick and Misako’s Lightning Rider), along with brand-new abilities like guard-crush attacks and lift-off combos. Recruited foes are back to assist in battle — this time you can hold two at once! — plus you can now enlist the help of hired henchmen who pack even more of a punch!\n\n​River City is more alive than ever, with a day-night cycle, more-complex terrain, more shops, new hazards, hidden areas, and an abundance of destructible objects. The brawl will take players to numerous new and updated regions of the city — including downtown slums, a tech-company campus, and an enchanted forest — and pit them against an assortment of new enemies and bosses, such as the Dragon Twins (Ryuji and Ryuichi). Our heroes can even visit hideouts where they can store extra equipment, swap recruits, or just chill while listening to music.\n\nOther additions to River City Girls 2 include improved quest tracking, three difficulty settings, and a dynamic story system with dialogue that changes depending on the player-controlled characters. And, of course, the game features a new animated intro, new comic book-style cutscenes, and a new hard-hitting synthpop soundtrack from original River City Girls composer Megan McDuffee!"

All I know is that the only one that can turn a chance encounter into true love is me.\n\nThe heroine and protagonist suddenly start dating, and as they spend time together, they fall in love for real."

Makito is a game-loving student who is full of curiosity. He tries every game that comes out, but he had lately been dissatisfied with them.\n\nOne day, he received an invitation to the closed beta of an augmented reality (AR) game called ‘Harvest Onreal’. It was the highly anticipated newest work by Cymell Corporation, which had produced the prominent AR game ‘Cherry Blossom’. He was very excited to play it even though he had never seen a game labeled as a ‘live game’ genre before. He signed up for the game without reading the user agreement at all and later found out that he could not exit the game nor turn off the AR.\n\nMakito got others around him caught up in it as well: game-loving lady-like underclassman Lilia, the most powerful (and short) upperclassman Komachi, transfer student Yuuka who he met by chance at the beach, and his genius programmer younger sister Sumi. They gathered together as the ‘next-generation club’ with the goal of clearing the game.\n\nAno Ko wa Ore kara Hanarenai\nOn his first day since transferring to Shihouin Gakuen, Hiroto happened to watch a girl confess to her senior in the courtyard. He wondered if this was what a riajuu was like. “Do you envy them so much?” Next to him was a blushing girl who then offered to make him into a riajuu, which he said yes to in surprise. But how does one become a riajuu? Make friends and go out together? Or be all lovey-dovey with a girl? Is it possible for them to be like that?"

The tournament victor has the potential to be awakened as the Blade Stranger—the savior who can vanquish Lina and protect the motes from further harm! Developed by Studio Saizensen, Blade Strangers is a hardcore old-school fighting game. The streamlined four-button control scheme makes it easy for beginners to deal out damage from day one…but the intricate combos, counters and specials give tournament-caliber players plenty of opportunities for frame counting, chain construction and hit-box science."

Discover how your creations work with the Nintendo Switch technology through handy tutorials, and when you’re ready to try making something uniquely yours, use the software’s intuitive, interactive Toy-Con Garage and Toy-Con Garage VR programming tools to explore new ways to play with your creations, invent new ones, and even make your own quick-play VR games!"

        "synopsis": "Brawlout packs a punch with couch and online play modes, blending platform fighter mechanics and traditional fighting game play into a stylish and fluid battle royale.\n\nRather than slow-paced defensive battles, Brawlout goes all-out with the lightning-fast aerobatics which platform fighters are famous for.\n\nStriking the balance between the growing competitive scene and the genre’s party game roots, Brawlout hopes to cater to the veteran platform fighter, the casual fan and the newcomer looking to make their mark.\n\nEach character in Brawlout has their own unique playstyle, catering to specific character archetypes seen in other fighters. Whether you’re a die-hard grappler or a rushdown fiend, there is a fighter for you in Brawlout.\n\nThere are currently six original characters and two popular indie characters to choose from that allow for varied play styles. As well as cosmetic skins, each original Brawlout character has three Variants; alt versions of the character with different stats, outfits and even new moves. With these Variants, Brawlout’s cast numbers 18 individual fighters. Find the fighter and Variant that’s right for you and tear it up on the battlefield.\n\nCombined with familiar movement techniques like wavedashing and airdodging, Brawlout adds some extra mechanics seen in other fighting games. The Rage Meter builds up as you both deal and take damage, allowing you either break combos with the Rage Burst or unleash hell with the Rage Mode. The Rage Burst pushes opponents back, breaking their combos and allowing players to create some breathing room at the cost of half their Rage Meter. If the meter fills, you can activate the Rage Mode, increasing the knockback you deal while reducing the amount you take.\n\nAs for modes, Brawlout has all you’d expect from a normal platform fighter and then some. Up to four players can compete in either timed, stock or team battles:\n\nAll on the same device\nEach with their own device, without any internet connection, playing nearby\nOnline either with friends or other Brawlout players\nAI opponents are also available if you want to practice your team combos with a friend, or if you need to fill out a free for all. Train with Advanced Tutorials or go in for yourself in challenging Arcade Towers"

Que vous soyez du genre à attraper sans cesse vos ennemis ou à foncer dans le tas sans vous arrêter, il y a un combattant adapté à chaque type de joueur dans Brawlout.\n\nBrawlout propose des combats à quatre en ligne et en local, incluant le multijoueur local que ce soit en temps, en vie ou en matchs par équipes. Durant tout le combat, battez-vous pour faire monter la Jauge de Rage du personnage, ce qui alimente de puissantes attaques spéciales. Chaque combattant est complet, qu'il soit doté de puissants projectiles ou bien de cinglantes attaques à longue portée pouvant évoluer à travers de nombreuses options de combos et d'actions techniques avancées. Le tout combiné à des techniques de mouvements avancées comme le wavedashing ou l'esquive aérienne, Brawlout ajoute de nouvelles mécaniques de jeu pour garder l'action rapide et fluide.\n\nEn ce qui concerne les modes de jeu disponibles, Brawlout a de quoi répondre à toutes les attentes concernant un jeu de ce type.\n\n    Jusqu'à quatre joueurs* ont la possibilité de s'affronter en temps, en vie ou en matchs par équipes, le tout sur la même console.\n    Jeu en local : chaque joueur utilise sa propre console pour jouer sans qu'une connexion Internet soit nécessaire**.\n    Jeu en ligne*** : avec des amis ou d'autres joueurs.

Voyagez à travers un monde extraterrestre hostile, découvrez des tonnes d'armes et d'améliorations de capacités et trouvez votre rôle dans cette histoire de science-fiction mystérieuse.\n\nLe big bang\nAprès avoir détruit un centre de recherche sur Terre suite à une expérience ratée, un jeune scientifique dénommé Trace se réveille dans un monde biomécanique étrange appelé Sudra. Dans ce royaume cauchemardesque, vivent des mélanges surréalistes de formes de vie corrompues et de structures technologiques imposantes, oubliées là par une race extraterrestre incroyablement avancée il y a bien longtemps.\n\nSudra a depuis des temps immémoriaux été abandonnée par toute trace de civilisation cohérente et pacifique. Les Rusalki, une race d'énormes machines possédant une conscience résident sous la surface de la planète, la protègent contre les envahisseurs malintentionnés. Trace apprend rapidement que les savants Rusalki dépérissent et que leur destin est intimement lié au sort de l'univers tout entier.\n\nAvancez sans peur\nSeul, vous parcourez un vaste monde interconnecté en faisant parler vos armes pour recomposer le puzzle de l'histoire mystérieuse de la planète en utilisant les indices disséminés aux quatre coins de ce monde isolé.\n\nAxiom Verge est fortement inspiré par l'aspect d'exploration qui qui caractérise les jeux d'aventure classiques de l'ère 16 bits. Au début de votre voyage, de larges zones de la carte seront inaccessibles, mais en trouvant de nouveaux objets, vous serez en mesure de creuser la roche, de vous propulser au-dessus des abîmes et même de vous téléporter à travers les murs, ce qui vous donnera accès à de nouvelles possibilités.\n\nArmez-vous pour le combat\nAssemblez des armes uniques et variées pour combattre les monstres grotesques et violents qui ont élu domicile à Sudra. Verrouillez les ennemis à proximité et chargez le Kilver d'électricité avant de libérer une décharge foudroyante sur eux, ou encore des projectiles de feu qui rebondissent sur les murs avec l'arme appelée Reflector. Avec plus de 20 armes différentes à découvrir et à améliorer, vous pourrez varier votre style de jeu et combattre les ennemis comme vous le souhaitez.\n\nPerfectionnez votre arsenal en récoltant les Nodes cachés, des améliorations spéciales vous conférant une puissance de feu supérieure. Améliorez tous les aspects de vos armes comme les dommages qu'elles peuvent infliger, leur portée et la taille des projectiles qu'elles envoient. Vous pouvez également augmenter la taille de votre barre de vie en récoltant des Nodes de santé, pour faire de vous un combattant encore plus redoutable.\n\nDompter le monde\nUtilisez l'Address Disruptor pour corrompre et modifier l'environnement autour de vous afin de manipuler le monde habituellement oppressant de Sudra à votre guise. Cet outil très pratique peut affecter certains ennemis et environnements de manière inattendues : les créatures tirant des missiles peuvent être altérées pour remplir votre barre de santé ou les bulles d'air ascendantes peuvent être transformées en plateformes solides sur lesquelles vous pouvez monter.\n\nModifiez encore davantage votre environnement avec le Passcode Tool déblocable, ce gadget très utile vous permet de modifier radicalement les lois qui gouvernent le monde qui vous entoure. En saisissant certains codes, dont la plupart sont disséminés à travers le monde, Trace pourra sauter encore plus haut, tirer plus vite ou même lire les langages ancestraux de Sudra. L'écran tactile du Wii U GamePad vous permet de taper des codes et voir immédiatement leurs effets sans avoir à mettre le jeu en pause.\nÀ toute allure\n\nPour ceux qui aiment aller vite, Axiom Verge propose un mode Speedrun dédié. Ce mode de jeu est particulièrement à l'attention des joueurs qui aiment défier l'horloge. Jouez à travers un environnement fluide, passez les scènes cinématiques et les dialogue pour terminer le jeu en un temps record.\n\nExplorez chaque recoin de ce monde extraterrestre, débloquez tout un arsenal d'armes puissantes et de capacités, et découvrez la vérité dans Axiom Verge, un jeu d'action et d'exploration old-school sur le Nintendo eShop de la Nintendo Switch.\n    Explorez un vaste monde extraterrestre isolé et vivez une histoire de science-fiction épique\n    Débloquez un arsenal d'armes, de capacités et d'outils qui vous aideront pour le combat et l'exploration\n    Utilisez l'Address Disruptor pour modifier les ennemis et votre environnement\n    Foncez à travers le jeu à toute allure grâce au mode Speedrun dédié et terminez le jeu en temps record"

The heroes need to work as a team to fight the chaos and terror that that grips the town.\n\nFrom the creators of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, comes South Park™: The Fractured But Whole™, a sequel to South Park™: The Stick of Truth™, winner of 25 video game awards.\n\nPlayers will once again assume the role of the New Kid.

At night, a whole new world opens up where your alter ego can harness its powers to do whatever it takes to save the town.\n\nCOON AND FRIENDS, ASSEMBLE!\nRecruit up to 12 members of Coon and Friends to your cause, including Mysterion, The Human Kite, and the infamous Coon himself.

Well, there’s always pinball! However, Haruka’s “experiments”, conveniently located in the local arcade, have once again caused havoc for the girls. This time her concoction has mentally turned some of her fellow shinobi into animals and the only way to reverse the effects is by using the mystical Peach Ball, which just so happens to fit perfectly in a pinball machine. Plunge into this new adventure and flip, bump, spin, or ricochet the Peach Ball onto the confused shinobi to return them to their normal selves. With customizable tables, special minigames, a story mode, and fan-favorite additional modes including diorama mode and the dressing room, Peach Ball Senran Kagura is set to be one of the hottest pinball games yet."

Introducing &quot;RACE MODE&quot;! In this 2 player split screen race, friends (or enemies) can compete against each other through individual chapters, randomized levels, or the entire game!

You are a trader who charters a boat to take on the massive venture of creating a world map.\n\nAre you ready to reveal the true shape of the world?\n\nYou listen to the reports of Admirals returned from their explorations and use them as a basis for creating a map. The reports from these Admirals range vastly, from the authentic to somewhat dubious tales of monsters. Thus, depending on what you approve or disapprove, the shape of the world can change greatly.\n\nPerhaps the continents we know now will not exist, while Atlantis and Mu take their place on the map. The only finished map of the world will be a &quot;subjective world&quot; that reflects your values, and one where only that which is approved by you becomes the truth.\n\n*This game can be played only in English or Japanese."

        "synopsis": "Return to Fuschia village, where it all began, and re-experience the thrilling One Piece saga as it takes you from a super-scaled recreation of the battle at Fishman Island all the way to the very latest episodes in Dressrosa, the island ruled by Donquixote Doflamingo the &quot;Heavenly Demon&quot;.\n\nThe latest translations of Shonen Jump scans have revealed the details sorrounding the debuting cooperative mode, more specifically the new &quot;Bond Rush&quot;.\n\nThe new attack works by calling another friendly character out at the end of your attack, where they will seamlessly carry on the existing combo. It is strongly implied that certain characters, the most obvious being Luffy and Sabo, will have super special bonds that are designed specifically with the pairs in mind - however this has not been confirmed.\n\nCharacter details are always exciting for games with such impressive casts and Bandai Namco are not depriving us of the sweet sweet anticipation that goes along with these announcements either! Doflamingo, Fujitora, and Luffy's older brother Sabo have already been confirmed as playable characters, with many more on the way as well as the original cast we all know and love from Pirate Warriors 2.\n\nOf course One Piece moving to the latest generation of consoles comes with a whole slew of technical improvements. From the scans and gameplay videos alone it is safe to say One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3 will be graphically impressive."

A long-abandoned home for the mentally ill, recently re-opened by the &quot;research and charity&quot; branch of the transnational Murkoff Corporation, the asylum has been operating in strict secrecy… until now. Acting on a tip from an anonymous source, independent journalist Miles Upshur breaks into the facility, and what he discovers walks a terrifying line between science and religion, nature and something else entirely. Once inside, his only hope of escape lies with the terrible truth at the heart of Mount Massive.\n\nContinue to explore the dark world of the Murkoff Corporation with the included Outlast: Whistleblower DLC. You will play as Waylon Park, a software engineer under contract with Murkoff and the man who emailed journalists around the world - including Miles - at the beginning of Outlast. Spending a couple of weeks at Mount Massive, during which he was unable to even talk to his wife and son thanks to strict security protocols, Waylon developed a deep-seated distrust of the profit-motivated scientists and doctors leading dangerous and irresponsible experiments on their patients. Identifying with those poor souls fueled Waylon's anger, and set the stage for his unmasking of Mount Massive's rotten core. Although Whistleblower tells the story that led to Outlast, it will actually stretch past the events of the first game to show the final chapter in Mount Massive Asylum's story.\n\nOutlast and the Outlast: Whistleblower DLC is a true survival horror experience which aims to show that the most terrifying monsters of all come from the human mind.\n\nFeatures:\n\nTrue Survival Horror Experience: You are no fighter - if you want to survive the horrors of the asylum, your only chance is to run... or hide\nImmersive Graphics: AAA-quality graphics give players a detailed, terrifying world to explore\nHide and Sneak: Stealth-based gameplay, with parkour-inspired platforming elements\nUnpredictable Enemies: Players cannot know when - and from where - one of the asylum's terrifying inhabitants will finally catch up to them\nReal Horror: Outlast's setting and characters are inspired by real asylums and cases of criminal insanity"

Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding, visceral and cathartic action game.\n\nExperience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath. No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs; new paths you’ve unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.\n\nSpeaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it’s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Patience, you’ll get better!… eventually.\n\nFeatures:\n\nRogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.\n\n2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll, more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay… The unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run.\n\nNonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts? Once unlocked, special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build, your play style, or just your mood.\n\nExploration: Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes. Take a moment to stroll the towers and breath in that fresh sea mist infused air..."

I will tell you your role. ”Chizuru tells Maria in a mechanical tone of voice that if she succeeds in this “experiment,” she will be released, and then suddenly hangs up. However, there is no indication of when the experiment will begin. Or perhaps it is already beginning? At any rate, it is clear that you have gotten dragged into an unusual situation. While Chizuru’s goals are unclear, you have to find a way to escape from this place as quickly as possible."

Vous gagnez de l'argent en tombant sur des cases de propriétés sur lesquelles il est possible d'investir, comme un restaurant de sushis à Ginza ou une boutique d'objets dérivés de dessins animés à Akihabara. Après avoir investi, vous devez attendre jusqu'au mois de mars pour découvrir à quel point vos investissements ont été rentables. Pendant ce temps, soyez à l'affût : des monstres errants peuvent vous inonder de richesses... ou vous mettre des bâtons dans les roues ! Vous pouvez également obtenir de l'argent en tombant sur les cases d'objets, qui vous aideront à atteindre vos objectifs ou à ruiner les plans de vos rivaux. Si vous terminez la partie avec plus d'argent que les autres joueurs... à vous la victoire !\n\n1. Un peu de jugeote, un brin de courage et une bonne dose de chance ! Le dé et les événements aléatoires influeront sur votre destin... mais ce sera à vous d'investir avec sagesse, de prendre des risques calculés et de compter sur le bon vouloir des monstres pour devenir le prochain milliardaire japonais !\n\n2. Plus de 30 objets et 50 monstres ! Vous rencontrerez des dizaines d'objets et de monstres, chacun doté de ses propres effets. Utilisez-les pour embêter vos adversaires, ruiner leurs investissements et leur faire la vie dure. Mais faites attention, car s'ils peuvent vous aider à gagner de l'argent à leurs dépens, ils peuvent aussi réaliser de mauvais achats ou investissements en votre nom. Cela peut renverser la situation à tout moment, alors étudiez les monstres pour savoir quand il faut s'éloigner... et quand il faut se précipiter dessus !\n\n3. Plein de modes de jeu pour un maximum de chaos ! Le mode Tournoi est une version solo qui dure 30 ans en jeu, tandis que le mode Escarmouche est une expérience multijoueur rapide qui ne dure que 36 mois. Mais que ce soit à long ou à court terme, l'adrénaline sera au rendez-vous !\n\n4. Montrez à vos amis qui est le patron ! Jouez avec vos amis en local !\n\n5. Il existe des cartes jouables cachées comme l'Île aux monstres.\n\n6. Un jeu familial qui permet aux enfants d'apprendre l'importance des investissements !"

Over 30 items and 50 monsters! You’ll encounter dozens of items and monsters, each with their own effects. Use them to push your opponents around, ruin their investments, and generally make their lives miserable. But be careful, because while they may help you earn money and pull ahead, they can also make bad purchases or investments on your behalf. This can change the game at a moment’s notice, so study the monsters well to make sure you know when to walk away, and when to run!\n3. Multiple Modes Means Maximum Mayhem! Tournament Mode is a single-player version that lasts for 30 in-game years, while Skirmish Mode is a quick multiplayer experience that lasts a mere 36 months. Whether long or short-term, it’s sure to get the adrenaline pumping!\n4. Show Your Friends Who’s Boss! Play with your buddies locally!\n5. There are hidden playable maps like the Monster Island.\n6.

On the options screen, you can turn on or off settings such as those that intelligibly display player fighter and enemies’ hitbox, allowing you to freely customize the game to your play style\nNew Modes with Online Rankings - Online rankings are supported for both “Score Attack Mode,” in which players compete for a high score using a fixed difficulty level, and “Replay Mode+,” in which players can challenge their personal best score (replay data) for each stage. A “Practice Mode,” in which players can practice by setting various specific situations, has also been implemented\nNew Fighters and a Never Before Experienced Psyvariar - In Psyvariar Delta, it is possible to play the stages of Psyvariar Revision with the Psyvariar Medium Unit fighters, as well as the stages of Psyvariar Medium Unit with the Psyvariar Revision fighters, realizing a never before done dream crossover. Also, in addition to two original fighters, a new fighter with a never before implemented original attack method will be added as downloadable content. It can be used in all modes. The new fighter downloadable content can be purchased from each platform’s online store on the same day Psyvariar Delta is released, and will also be included as a bonus code with the standard and limited editions of the game\nNew Music and Arrangements - In addition to background music from Psyvariar Medium Unit and Psyvariar Revision, players can also listen to background music from Psyvariar Reassemble for iOS. There are also a large number of new songs from WASi303, who has done many songs for the Psyvariar series in the past. New arrangements from wonderful composers well-acquainted with shooting games will also be added in accordance with new downloadable content fighters\n\nPsyvariar is a shoot ’em up that was first released for arcades in 2000. It's thrilling and strategic “Buzz System” in which the player powers up each time an enemy fighter’s bullets graze their fighter was popular among users. Psyvariar Delta is a high-resolution version of the debut title Psyvariar Medium Unit and its slightly modified upgrade Psyvariar Revision with newly added elements. While paying maximum respect to the original games’ feeling as shoot ’em ups, they have been reborn in the new form of Psyvarir Delta, which connects both titles with new elements."

Characters who have changed their EX weapons in Dynasty Warriors 7: Empires (which was released after Warriors Orochi 3, but before Ultimate) retain their older EX weapons in Ultimate instead of changing to their new EX weapons.\nDynasty Warriors characters are restricted to one Musou attack. Characters with a ground and aerial Musou attack in Dynasty Warriors 7 retain their ground Musou attack, while characters having two ground Musou attacks may retain either of theirs as their Musou attack.\nAs movesets are determined by weapon in Dynasty Warriors 7 rather than by character, characters sharing the same weapon in Dynasty Warriors 7 have altered charge attacks to differentiate them from each other.\nSamurai Warriors characters perform their Ultimate Musou attack in situations where the True Musou attack is available, to compensate for the lack of the Spirit Gauge.\nSamurai Warriors characters gain new Switch attacks, akin to weapon switching in Dynasty Warriors 7, for their use in Switch Combos."

Originally released in 1996, Resident Evil was then “remade” in 2002 from the ground up with new visuals, gameplay elements, environments and story details while retaining the survival horror atmosphere the series had become synonymous for. Both fans of the franchise who want a trip down memory lane and those who have yet to experience the game that coined the term survival horror for the gaming world will appreciate this definitive re-visit of that iconic 2002 Resident Evil title. The intense horror fans first experienced with the release of the original Resident Evil is back. Taking place in the now notorious Raccoon City, players will choose to take on the role of either S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Service) team member Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, who have been sent into the city to find the missing Bravo team. When the team is suddenly attacked by a ferocious group of mutated dogs, desperate for an escape they take shelter in the Mansion, but will they ever get out alive again? Players will need to be brave as they adventure through the dark, enclosed spaces searching out the horrors that await them. With limited ammo and survival items available gamers will need to keep their wits about them to survive the various traps and puzzles that greet them at every stage."

Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape!\n\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED &amp; RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\n\nOver 80 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&amp;-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment. Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed &amp; raise Dino Babies!\n\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\n\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage &amp; the elements.\n\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\n\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\n\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\n\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle.

Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!"

People quickly realized that these ancient passages lead to different realms and dimensions – providing brave and reckless adventurers with treasures beyond measure. Rynoka, a small commercial village, was founded near the excavation site providing refuge and a place for adventurers to sell their hard-earned riches.\n\nMoonlighter is an Action RPG with rogue-lite elements following the everyday routines of Will, an adventurous shopkeeper that dreams of becoming a hero.\n\nSHOPKEEPING\n\nWhile conducting your business in Rynoka village, you can put items on sale, set their price carefully, manage gold reserves, recruit assistants and upgrade the shop. Be careful though – some shady individuals may want to steal your precious wares!\n\nFIGHT WITH STYLE\n\nDefeat various enemies and bosses, and revel in challenging and deep combat mechanics.

How you battle your enemies is up to you.\n\nMEET VILLAGERS\n\nGet to know your neighbors as you restore the prosperity of this small commercial hamlet. Help establish new businesses and watch them grow in the idyllic community of Rynoka.\n\nCRAFT &amp; ENCHANT\n\nUnderstanding the crafting and enchanting system is essential for your progression.

This creates a great deal of flexibility and spices up the way equipment is used.\n\nGET THE LOOT\n\nAccess strange worlds through otherworldly gates and collect valuable items from exotic civilizations: resources, weapons, armors and peculiar artifacts. Hoarding everything won't be possible - use the unique inventory system wisely to take the most profitable loot with you.\n\nOPEN THE GATES\n\nGates lead to different worlds. Each run is unique and forces you to make smart and calculated decisions. You never know what you will encounter next – that’s why you must be prepared for everything.\n\nNINTENDO SWITCH EXCLUSIVE CONTENT\n\nWhile wandering around Rynoka and its surroundings - you can encounter some peculiar items... and animal behaviours!\n\n- Hero Sword and Bow set - old weapons said to have been carried by a legendary hero, made from materials that can't be found in this world. You can upgrade them at the Forge, of course!\n\n- Ruccos - They appear in Town like any normal bird... but if you attack the tree they are sitting on (three times) - then a horde of those cute fellows is going to appear to bother Will (until he goes to a dungeon or enters the shop)."

You can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your character's special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned.

Measure your devotion and your bravery by journeying into the deepest darkness for answers to questions that will challenge your very existence.\n\nDark Devotion features a richly detailed, immersive narrative that unfolds a somber tale of your Templar religion’s irresistible calling. Every encounter challenges your fortitude, piety, and conviction as you move deeper into your cursed pilgrimage. Spanning four unique worlds, each with its own incredibly detailed environments, you’ll wield dozens of weapons in your quest to discover the Temple’s secret: all the while assailed by dark enemies and devious bosses whose core mission is to destroy your soul and damn you forever.\n\nThroughout Dark Devotion you’ll discover an array of weapons, armors, and relics with which to enhance your character. Each item has its own attributes and statistics and is customizable with mystical runes. It is essential that you maximize your strengths and adapt your inventory to the enemy you’re facing. Choose wisely...\n\nDark Devotion is a story of perseverance, dedication, and secrets. Every chest you open, every item you encounter holds another piece of the story: be it a letter, weapon, or clue, all will help you on your quest. Whether you find these secrets amongst the shadows or in the dead hand of another character ...well, that all depends.\n\nIn the Temple, Faith is your only recourse against the heathen droves. Defeat them to collect Faith and unlock secret paths, special chests, and more. But remember to use your Faith sparingly. Nothing lasts forever.\n\nThe Temple yearns to see you dead. Your survival depends on using the right item at the right time to heal your wounds or dispel a curse. Some of these items can be looted, others are scattered throughout the Temple in secret places. Employ them wisely… your life depends on it.\n\nThe eye of your God is ever-watchful. Complete an act of bravery or skill, and your God might bless you. But the Temple is also rife with despair and sickness, ready to destroy those who lack courage and temperance. Learn quickly its ways, or suffer.\n\nSalvation is fleeting, so choose your route wisely. Every world in Dark Devotion offers several different paths. Each one is\noriginal, but all are interconnected, and the only commonality they share is that there is no turning back.\n\nCompleting your quest requires shrewd interpretation of the secrets shrouded within the Temple. It’s easy to get lost, though this might bring you favor...depending on the secret you uncover. Perhaps the Temple will reveal a hidden altar where one’s story can be saved if one honors the Temple appropriately...or perhaps not."

Line up scattered enemies and plan your attack to maximize damage with the new, ring-based battle system that requires both puzzle-solving skills and a quick wit.\n\nMario and Luigi receive an invitation from Princess Peach to attend an origami festival and excitedly hurry to Toad Town…but something’s amiss. After investigating the eerily empty town, the duo finds a fearsome (and folded) Princess Peach—she’s been turned into origami by King Olly, ruler of the Origami Kingdom! With five giant streamers under his control, King Olly binds Princess Peach’s Castle and transports it to a distant mountain as part of his plan to re-fold the world.\n\nOn his journey to liberate Peach’s Castle and repair the ravaged paper landscape, Mario meets Olivia, King Olly’s sister, and the two join forces to put a stop to Olly’s origami onslaught. Even Bowser falls victim to Olly’s plot when his minions are turned into origami Folded Soldiers and betray their Koopa king, forcing him to ally with Mario and Olivia!\n\nBattle the Folded Soldiers in ring-based battles that challenge you to strategically line up enemies to maximize damage! Out of battle, Mario can use the arm-extending 1,000-Fold Arms ability in specific spots to interact with the landscape to pull, peel, hit, and more! Join Mario, Olivia, and their companions on a journey of laughter and emotion, thrills, and a whole lot of folding."

It’s also the game that inspired my favorite TV game ad of all time:\n\nDevil May Cry 2 (2003)\nTaking place after the events of the first Devil May Cry, this sequel strives for a more cinematic look and feel to combat, changing things up in how the camera behaves, but also taking extreme care to make the animations more natural and fluid. Plus, you can unlock and play as Trish, featuring her own unique weapons and move set.\n\nDevil May Cry 3: Special Edition (2006)\nFocusing on the origins of our favorite demon hunter, this prequel features a much younger and more rambunctious Dante who cares very little about how much damage he’s doing to even his own shop as long as he can chew his pizza and kick some butt. And he runs out of pizza.\n\nDevil May Cry 3: Special Edition quickly took the spotlight as a fan favorite with the addition of combat Styles that significantly change the way you slay demons. These Styles can be selected and upgraded between each mission. This game also puts a spotlight on Dante’s relationship with his twin brother Vergil, who is an unlockable character with his own move set and gameplay.\n\nNote: DMC 1 comes with a cartridge, and the DMC 2 and 3 come with a download code."

To complete a scenario, the player must accomplish scenario objectives. Some scenarios are longer, with multi-part missions or have new objectives added as the story unfolds. On battlefield, the player and enemy take turns to order their units with commands available, such as movement, attacking, forming squads and casting &quot;Spirit Commands&quot;, a set of magic-like spells unique to each pilot. Once the scenario is cleared, more dialogue is exchanged between characters before the player is taken to an intermission menu. Here, units can be upgraded or optional parts installed, characters' stats and skills can be changed or upgraded, and other maintenance actions can be performed before the player continues on with the game.\n\nGameplay elements from previous games return, including the Skill Route and Skill Program function introduced in Super Robot Wars V, as well as the Tac Management system and Hard Mode settings as they appeared in Super Robot Wars X.

After dozing off at the tail end of a long night of gaming, Rad awakens to find his dusty old console has turned itself back on. Suddenly a vortex emerges and he's sucked into his TV, where he finds himself the star in his very own video game adventure.\n\nDusty is Rad's good-hearted but foul-mouthed, now-sentient game console. His clock speed isn't what it used to be, but what he lacks for in megahertz he makes up for with experience and attitude!\n\nRad &amp; Dusty's adventure takes them through many dangerous stages of action-packed, humor-filled, hardcore platforming fun. This decaying jungle world has been infected by a fierce corruption, and it's up to the unlikely buddy-duo Rad and Dusty to save the jungle's inhabitants and restore the Elder Tree as guardian of the land.\n\nWeapons: Dusty arms Rad with a variety of radical bad-ass weaponry. The Bolt Blaster has unlimited ammo, is easy to use, and more than enough firepower to get the job done. The Phoenix Cannon shoots out a fiery bird whose wingspan lights enemies ablaze as it flies by.\n\nSounds &amp; Music: Composer Andrew Hulshult combined his years of musical experience (both performing and writing) with his passion for retro-style gaming to create an amazing and authentic soundtrack for the game complete with MIDI-inspired music... And synthesizers!\n\nThe Pixelverse: While Rad and Dusty are a great team, only Dusty can enter the electrified Pixelverse -- a dangerous spacetime-breaking region that exists behind the game world. Dusty enters the Pixelverse when necessary to repair glitches in the running game world, allowing both Rad &amp; Dusty to continue their journey.\n\nClassic Easter Eggs: The game features hard-to-find collectibles in sometimes even harder-to-find classic secret rooms. Use your precision platforming skills to collect 'em all.\n\nThe Radical Edition for the Nintendo Switch system also includes these brand new additions!\n\n• 2 Player Couch Co-op - Play together with a friend! Enemies can prepare themselves for tough battles!\n\n• Battle Mode – Tired of team play? Fight against your friends and show them who’s boss!\n\n• New Playable Characters\n\n• New Abilities!\n\n• New Minigames!\n\n• New Overworld!\n\n• New Levels!\n\n• And tons of new secrets, collectibles and unlockables!"

Dead by Daylight is a 1v4 multiplayer game that allows you to choose between playing an unstoppable Killer and one of four Survivors trying to evade a gruesome death. This edition includes 9 killers and 10 survivors to choose from and 3 cosmetic packs.\n\n SURVIVE TOGETHER… OR NOT - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground?\n\n A FEAST FOR KILLERS - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer, you can play as anything from a powerful slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your killing grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims. This deadly game of cat and mouse also lets you meet some of the most iconic Killers and Survivors from horror franchises.\n\n DEEPER AND DEEPER - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer.\n\n REAL PEOPLE, REAL FEAR - The unique levels and real human reactions to pure horror make each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it’s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what’s hiding in The Fog."

Each locomotive was paired with a humanoid control module, so-called RailRoad, that aided the train operator. However, many rail lines had been discontinued due to the rising popularity of ‘aerocrafts’, a safe and convenient aerial mode of transport. As such, their accompanying railroads also went into a deep sleep.\n\nSoutetsu had lost his entire family in a rail accident and was adopted into the Migita household, which runs a shochu brewery in the city of Ohitoyo. He returned to his hometown to save it from the potential water pollution that would occur if they accepted the proposal to build an aerocraft factory nearby. He woke up the RailRoad Hachiroku by accident and became her owner. For different purposes, they agreed to help find her lost locomotive, with the help of his stepsister Hibiki, the town’s mayor and local railway chief, Paulette and others."

Alchemy is of course a primary focal point of the series, as much of the gameplay is immersed within it and players will need to master synthethis techniques in order to progress the story, as well as allow for more diverse creations through gathering materials. Anyone who’s new to the Atelier series we’ll be honest, the gameplay will require you to do a lot of gathering when compared to battling, and so therefore this creates a slow paced progression system which places more emphasis on creation than actual battles over time.\nThis isn't to say that battles aren't frequent it's more that your alchemy level plays a very big role in the game and is of great benefit during long battles, so taking your time is key. With that being said, this brings us to Ryza no Atelier ～Tokoyami no Joou to Himitsu no Kakurega～ (Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness &amp; the Secret Hideout), the brand new title in the ongoing Atelier universe. Built with the intention of enticing new players but introducing new mechanics for veterans to enjoy, will Ryza and her friends create an adventure that will be memorable? Read on to find out more."

Players once again take control of the little red ninja Jajamaru as he attempts to rescue Princess Sakura from the evil clutches of the Catfish Pirate and his minions.\n\nJaJaMaru Ninpouchou (1989, Famicom)\nUnlike the two previous Ninja Jajamaru-Kun games, which were action platformers, Ninpou Chou is a traditional JRPG. The player walks around a world map visiting towns and dungeons and occasionally fighting random encounters using a separate turn-based combat screen.\n\nJajamaru Gekimaden: Maboroshi no Kinmajou(1990, Famicom)\nPlayers control the protagonist character through towns, dungeons, and a world map; each different type of map features top-down exploration. When moving through a dungeon, the protagonist will gradually recover health; the protagonist can equip different types of weapons and items that he can buy or find and use them during combat. Dungeons are made up of several rooms with enemies inside. Occasionally, an enemy will drop money when defeated, which can be used to buy items or heal health points at an inn.\n\nNinja Jajamaru: Ginga Daisakusen(1991, Famicom)\nUsers can play either as Jajamaru or Sakurahime. Ninja Jajamaru: Ginga Daisakusen is somewhat of a departure from previous 8-bit entries in that it draws some design elements from other contemporary platformers creating a different feel when compared to older games. Character sprites are bigger and more cartoonish. Players jump on top of enemies to defeat them. A myriad of powerups can be found inside of blocks scattered across each level. A new status bar on the bottom of the screen displays various information such as remaining lives, currently active powerups, etc. In certain levels, pipes can be used to access sub-areas.\n\nNinja Jajamaru: The Great Yokai Battle (New)\nJaJaMaru and friends will face against the largest yo-kai army invasion in history! There are more than 20 playable characters with various abilities, including returning yokai from the series plus the newly debuting JaJaMaru family and more. By collecting the “Golden Beads” and “Souls” that drop from defeated enemies, you can unlock new playable characters. There is also support for single-screen local two-player multiplayer."

In addition, he also knows that one of the Seirei stones was entrusted secretly to King Silverna from Vorg's homeland, the Kingdom of Miltia.\n\nVorg, who was a holy knight in Miltia, was in the forest town of Neraphai working for a mission when the king of Satan, Ifter, invaded the Kingdom of Miltia with Dhatilos armies.\n\nUpon hearing the news, Vorg immediately returned to Miltia, but the kingdom has been destroyed.\n\nAfter 7 years, a dark shadow went into the royal room inside the Silverna castle.

He was locked up by the 4 magic stones but was freed by summoning a country which aims to achieve victory in the war using him.\n\nNebirus, as an act of revenge, controlled the mind of the god of the moon using his dark power.

And the entire Megalith fell into the abyss of destruction and chaos.\n\nNebirus' army has started to move towards the god of the sun. The god of the sun, who was threatened by Nebirus' move, entrusted the weapons of the gods to 4 dragon knights and ordered them to overthrow Nebirus.\n\nZero Gunner 2\nLet’s blast off every enemy's planes from various sides of your screen.\n\nFans who have enjoyed Psikyo Shooting will definitely enjoy this Zero Gunner 2."
